        <summary>What is The Elrendar Fellowship?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Fellowship is a cohort of sorcerers, mages, clerics, historians, scholars, explorers, and all manner of elven fighters who are dedicated to safeguarding Quel'Thalas from greater threats. Largely removed from the faction wars, the Fellowship has maintained a steady hand, and has worked to preserve the strength of the elven kingdom. In game, the cohort is a heavy roleplay and PVE focused guild, with immersive events and stories that span both faction, and realm.

        <summary>How is the Fellowship run?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Out-of-character, the Fellowship is guided by a small team of executive leaders, but in character, all members of the cohort technically hold voting rights. Each member acts of their own accord In-Character, and when seeking the full support of the Fellowship to pursue an endeavor, a vote must be held to formally commit resources in support of the cause. When it comes to Out-of-character matters, the executive leadership teams acts directly and without member consultation.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Where is the game system for RP from?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Elrendar Swords & Spells (ESS) system is a semi-original game system built specifically for the guild; the simple roll system is loosely inspired by the Conquest system used in World of Warcraft by many roleplay guilds and communities, though many of the other components (especially the Monster Manual and Encounter Builder) are built around the ESS core.
