      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is The Elrendar Fellowship?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Fellowship is a cohort of sorcerers, mages, clerics, historians, scholars, explorers, and all manner of elven fighters who are dedicated to safeguarding Quel'Thalas from greater threats. Largely removed from the faction wars, the Fellowship has maintained a steady hand, and has worked to preserve the strength of the elven kingdom. In game, the cohort is a heavy roleplay and PVE focused guild, with immersive events and stories that span both faction, and realm.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How is the Fellowship run?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Out-of-character, the Fellowship is guided by a small team of executive leaders, but in character, all members of the cohort technically hold voting rights. Each member acts of their own accord In-Character, and when seeking the full support of the Fellowship to pursue an endeavor, a vote must be held to formally commit resources in support of the cause. When it comes to Out-of-character matters, the executive leadership teams acts directly and without member consultation.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How are roleplay events handled?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Any player can organize a run story events, though scheduling large events or long term stories must always be cleared with the OOC leadership first to prevent conflicts; we don't really curate the content, but we do try to keep an organized calendar. ALL of our schedueld events are visible on Discord. We encourage interested players to stick to the guidelines and structures set out in our <a href="system.html">gameplay system</a> section to keep things consistent and accessible. The hope and expectation is that members will take it on themselves to initiate spontaenous RP whenever we're not engaged in a larger event, and we do openly embrace open-world rp opportunities.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Can non-officers run events?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Yes!

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How active is the guild, and how many members do you have?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            While hard numbers of current members will fluctuate, we aim for a maximum cap of about 30-40 active players to ensure we have a tight knit and easy to run community. We are active mostly in the afternoons and evenings throughout the week, with spontaenous world-rp happening almost every single day, and events twice a week if not more. This is subject to change depending on circumstances.
          </p>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What are your usual hours of activity?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Typically evenings throughout the week. Main campaigns are currently slated to start some weeknights around 6pm Central Standard Time (7pm EST), but on weekends events can be scheduled at any time. We strive to give one or two weeks notice for scheduling.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What sort of events do you run?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            My my, you have so many questions! But we like this one. There are three mandates the Fellowship holds: 
            <li>Spread magical teachings to the elven people, and foster respect for its power.</li>
            <li>Research darker magics to safeguard the High Home against them, and hunt the monsters born of such power.</li>
            <li>Preserve elven history and culture.</li>

            These three mandates lead us to a broad slate of themes for events, including monster and demon hunting; magical instruction, research, and practice; exploration and archaeology; artifact recovery and acquisition; investigations and mysteries; and more.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>If I'm not on the guild's main server or faction, how do I join the Fellowship?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            <li>Go to <a href="apply.html">Apply</a>, fill out the application form, and submit.</li> 
            <li>You’ll get a Discord message as soon as we can reach out.</li> 
            <li>A member will reach out to speak with you, cover some basics, and then invite you in.</li> 
            <li>All members technically can review and admit new members, though there is a brief trial period to ensure it's a good fit.</li>
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
            Most players will hear back within a few hours to a single day.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What is the guild's onboarding process like?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            All members need to submit a super brief application on our <a href="apply.html">Apply Page</a>, but after that it really comes down to a conversation in character. There are only three ranks for the Fellowship: Ally (non members), Uninitiated (new members), and Cohort (members who have fully joined IC). Once your character fully commits themself, they're given a communication crystal and granted full member status.
          </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How does the guild communicate IC?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            All fellows of the order are given communication crystals that can be fashioned into rings, amulets, or any other sort of adornment. These are not telepathy gems, but instead can send a pulse like signal, beckoning individuals or the whole order to gather at the common space. <br><br> Too often, we've seen guilds use overly permissive communication systems (radios, telepathy gems, etc) in a way that removes potential struggle from situations. In a fantasy setting like WoW, we feel it's important to see how things unfold, and that the best sort of RP is face to face.

      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Aside from building an inclusive and engaged community that works to foster an immersive and rewarding RP culture, what goals does the Fellowship have?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The chief goal (aside from all that), is to negate the faction imbalance crisis faced by many RP servers. By building a cross faction and cross server community, we aim to ensure our members have a reliable strain of events and engaging RP opportunities that persist even amidst the ever-fluctuating populations of WoW servers.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Where is the game system for RP from?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The Elrendar Swords & Spells (ESS) system is an original game system built specifically for the guild; the simple roll structure is loosely inspired by the Conquest system used in World of Warcraft by many roleplay guilds and communities, though its components (especially the Monster Manual and Encounter Builder) are built specifically for the ESS core. This system will develop and improve over time with further refinements, but is the main system for the guild.
        </p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What other improvements or additions are coming?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            The ESS system will constantly see refinements, and our <a href="monsterguide.html">Monster Manual</a> is getting new entries and updates almost every day. In addition to the expansion of that database, we're currently working on developing a campaign-creation suite here on the website, similar to (and compatible with) the <a href="dm-assist.html">DM-Assist</a> app. Future developments will hopefully bring an online storage system for those campaigns, enabling users to save and share their campaigns without having to export and import them.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Is there a code of conduct?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Please see the <a href="conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> for this information.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>How do you handle meta-gaming and god-modding?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Players who are in violation of the guild's code of conduct will be given a swift, fair, and impartial investigation, and either be removed or warned of their actions. The Fellowship does not encourage nor condone such behaviors. Please see the <a href="conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> for this information.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Do I have to play an elf?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            This is really a case by case sort of thing; the Fellowship <strong>is</strong> and always was an elven order, though the world has changed and the need to safeguard the High Home is a serious task; in that regard, we're open to considering exceptions. This is not a sure thing for every character, but it's worth inquiring about. The one question we'd have you consider is <strong>why</strong> would a non-elf want to join <strong>this</strong> order in particular?

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>What roleplay addons do you require?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            We don't <strong>require</strong> any, though TRP3/TRP3 Extended, Emote Splitter, and Dice Master are commonly used by members.

      <details class="faq-item">
        <summary>Who can I talk to if I have more questions?</summary>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            You can always reach out to the guild master, Ansinosth Summerbough, on Discord @ <strong>silvertongue_scribe</strong>.
