          The Elrendar Fellowship has emerged from its treasured obscurity in order to better aid the nation of Quel'Thalas and its many diasporic tribes. Once an fabled order of sorcerers intent on educating the populace on the responsible use of magic, the order was shattered during the Fall of Quel'Thalas to the Scourge. In recent years, however, its ranks have slowly reforms, and now the order stands ready to help lead the elven people to a more prosperous future.
        <br><br>
          The Fellowship is, first and foremost, a heavy roleplay guild that is both cross faction and cross server. It is also a social and content focused guild, with a well balanced blending of the elements in order to offer an immersive and thrilling experience in Warcraft.
        <br><br>
        Members can expect and enjoy both long form and short campaigns, immersive roleplay centered PVE content and traditional non-RP content content as well.
