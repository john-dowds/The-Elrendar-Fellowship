      <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
      <p>
        This Code of Conduct exists to keep our community safe, welcoming, and creatively vibrant. 
        It applies to all spaces where the Fellowship gathers&mdash;in game, on voice/chat, and here on the website.
        There are two pillars:
        <strong>In‑Character (IC) Conduct</strong>, which governs how characters behave within the story,
        and <strong>Out‑of‑Character (OOC) Conduct</strong>, which governs how players treat one another.
      </p>

            <li><strong>No god‑modding:</strong> Do not control another player’s character, actions, emotions, or outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>No meta‑gaming:</strong> Keep OOC knowledge out of IC decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Check‑ins:</strong> If a scene escalates (violence, fear, grief), do quick OOC check‑ins to confirm comfort.</li>
            <li><strong>Retcons:</strong> If consent was unclear, a brief retcon is acceptable with agreement from all involved.</li>

            <li><strong>DM rulings:</strong> When a DM is present, their call stands for that scene; follow‑up after for feedback.</li>

          <ul>
            <li><strong>Administrative Approach:</strong> We don't have interest in heavily policing people's conduct. If you seem unable to adhere to our Code of Conduct, then it's clear we're not a good match for you. We don't want to force anyone to change themselves to fit our model; there are so many guilds that may be a better fit, and we want everyone to be comfortable in their social environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Zero harassment:</strong> No personal attacks, slurs, or targeted disruption. No doxxing or threats.</li>
            <li><strong>Boundaries:</strong> Honor stated content boundaries immediately, without debate. This includes in social chats.</li>
            <li><strong>Chat Etiquette:</strong> While dark humor and the like are not prohibited, the expectation is for it to punch upwards, instead of down.</li>
            <li><strong>Private matters:</strong> Do not share private logs, DMs, or personal information without consent.</li>

            <li><strong>Profiles:</strong> As above, what individual players put in their profile is their own business, but it should not violate any other part of our code of conduct. </li>
            <li><strong>Links:</strong> Links to things like f-lists and explicit art (or anything that may violate the WoW social policy and ToS) should be made on available on request and not openly provided.</li>

        <div class="faq-answer">
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Comms:</strong> Keep voice comms clear during events; reserve back‑channel chat for non‑blocking notes.</li>
            <li><strong>Chat:</strong> We're not going to police conversations save for clear cut violations of the code of conduct. If you have to be repeatedly warned about behavior in chat, though, it's a simple matter of us not being the right fit for you.</li>
            <li><strong>Spoilers:</strong> Use spoiler tags or give a heads‑up for major story info from recent content.</li>
            <li><strong>Disagreements:</strong> Take heated topics to DMs or a moderator; de‑escalate in public channels.</li>

      <h2>Enforcement &amp; Reporting</h2>
      <p>
        If you experience or witness a violation, contact an officer or Ansinosth. We will handle reports promptly, 
        fairly, and with discretion. Possible actions include: clarification, mediated conversation, temporary mute/suspension, 
        or removal from the community.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>How to report:</strong> DM a moderator as soon as possible.</li>
        <li><strong>Evidence helps:</strong> Screenshots/logs make it easier to review and resolve.</li>
        <li><strong>Appeals:</strong> You may request a post‑decision review by the council.</li>

        <li>Have your UI/addons and audio ready before start; observe push‑to‑talk etiquette in voice.</li>
        <li>Follow the event lead’s direction and the scene’s safety tools.Take initiative to get creative, but don't derail.</li>
